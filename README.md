A high-performance autocomplete search engine built from scratch using a Trie (prefix tree) and a Max-Heap Priority Queue.  
The backend is powered by Node.js + Express, and the frontend is built using React + Vite.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms, scalable search design, and full-stack engineering.  
It will soon include an interactive “Autocomplete Maze Game”, where the search engine becomes the core gameplay mechanic.
